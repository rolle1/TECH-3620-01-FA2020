## Basic Expo Commands

All of these commands should be run in a Terminal / Powershell Window.

## Logs in to your expo.io account

```
expo login
```

## <AppName> is a project folder can be called whatever we want

```
expo init <AppName>
```

## Changes Directory

```
cd <DirectoryName>
```

## Starts Expo Project

```
npm start
```

This will start an Expo Bundler that runs on your machine that can be accessed by your iPhone / Android device. You will need the Expo Apps installed on them and signed in.

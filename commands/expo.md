## Basic Expo Commands

All of these commands should be run in a Terminal / Powershell Window.

## Changes Directory (works both Mac and PC)

```
cd <DirectoryName>
```

```
expo login
```

## <AppName> is a project folder can be called whatever we want

```

```

```
npm start
```

This will start an Expo Bundler that runs on your machine that can be accessed by your iPhone / Android device. You will need the [Expo Mobile Clients](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/#2-mobile-app-expo-client-for-ios/) installed on your device and signed in.

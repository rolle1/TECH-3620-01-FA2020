### 3 Different Types of Navigation

### Stacked:
Basic Navigation in mobile apps, each view is "stacked" on top of each other with the user having the ability to swipe back and forth or touch buttons in the header bar. --ie Linkedin Home Screen to Messages.

### Tabbed:
Common style of navigation in mobile apps is tab-based navigation. This can be tabs on the bottom of the screen or on the top below the header (or even instead of a header). Tab navigation is used for similiar tasks --ie Linkedin Home, Network, Post, Notifications and Jobs Search.

### #Drawer:
Common pattern in navigation is to use drawer from left (sometimes right) side for navigating between screens. Mostly used for seldom used features. --ie Linkedin Profile, Settings / Groups, Discovery section
